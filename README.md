This project was created almost a year ago as part of a course at my university. It represents an intermediate version of a larger project. While I couldnâ€™t find the final version, this one is quite close to the original. The project involves a database that tracks and stores information about various movies and series. Additionally, there were two other folders that were part of the project, which unfortunately I can't find anymore: "descriptions", which contained text files with detailed descriptions of each movie or series, and "images", which contained cover images for the movies and series in the database.
